My hack uses an Asus Z370-Plus motherboard, i7-8700k CPU, and Radeon RX 470 GPU.

Hello guys, I already had my setup running for around 2 Months. No problems once it was running. This weekend I got my 10gbit network card, which I also want to pass through. The problem, the graphic card i am passing through to the vm is alot bigger than the card from the host system. And its blocking my third PCI Slot. So for the Network Card to fit, I needed to swap the graphic cards. Now my passing through card is in the primary slot, the host card in the secondary slot.

So I've been trudging along pretty damn well with this whole VFIO thing within the last week, and I'll be damned if I've not found my first hiccup that's got me utterly stumped. No amount of googling seems to come up with any solutions that actually work. I even tried passing the MB's onboard audio to the VM to just work around it, but still no joy. Other than this issue, I am thoroughly impressed with the performance once I worked through all the issues that needed to be rectified. Requisite. I had a perfectly working 10.14.3 build, but running the update to 10.14.4 has been problematic. While the system does work, I'm getting random kernel panics that make it super unstable. Now to get my laptop working with dual monitor output I had to use a Skylake spoof instead of my native Kaby Lake. I used Hackintool to originally get this all working, but now any framebuffer patch I output there I can't seem to make a bootable system. Has anyone else run into issues with this update? In Googli. My Mac has been restarting with the 'your computer has restarted because of a problem' message for a while now. Sometimes it's just the once, sometimes it's every few minutes. I can't figure out what exactly is causing it. I have uninstalled a few older apps that I don't use anymore, but there is obviously something that is still causing it. Any help is greatly appreciated! Here is the report for the crash: Wed May 1 16:20:46 2019 \ \ \ Panic Report \ \ \ panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffff. Hello,I recently installed FreeBSD 12.0 on a MacPro 1,1.

Hello! amp#x200B; I need some help to split my IOMMU groups, let’s start from the beginning. I have an Asrock J3455-ITX motherboard with the latest Proxmox version. On the motherboard there are an onboard NIC, an external NIC (plugged into the only one PCIe slot) and an external Wifi card (plugged into the M.2 slot). On the host proxmox I have a pfSense running in a VM and I would like to pass through my external NIC and the Wifi card but they are in the same IOMMU group than the onbord. Using xorg-server 1.20.3-1. After upgrading QT5 packages (see transaction log below) SDDM crashes and uses nearly 150% CPU. Also tried to start with multi-user.target (https://multi-user.target) instead of graphical.target (https://graphical.target) and run `startx` with `exec startkde` with no luck. Plasma starts but shows a lot of crash reports. `pacman` log: 2019-02-04 15:22 PACMAN Running '/usr/bin/pacman --color always --noconfirm -S -y' 2019-02-04 15:22 PACMAN synchroni. Hey guys. I have a 4770k with Z87X-UD4H and Rx 560. I was originally using Sierra for years and everything was perfect, and then went to shit as soon as I installed Mojave. I have now completely fresh installed Mojave, using a DSDT made for my setup over at Insanely Mac, and used the vanilla guide here for Haswell systems.

My MacBook has been giving me a Kernal Panic. macOS Sierra Version 10.12.6 Macbook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) Processor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 Memory: 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB Serial Number: C02JF21PDKQ2 Notes: - I haven't been using this MacBook in the last year or more. Could it just be full of dust or fans need cleaning? - It keeps pushing me to update to Mojave? Should I do that? Could it fix the issue? - This kernal panic happens Hi All, Not sure if this is the correct place for this (if not please direct me elsewhere), however I'm hoping someone can help decipher this error log for me. My partners 2016 13" MacBook Pro has been rebooting at random quite regularly (seems to normally happen from waking up from sleep). Initially we thought it was a hardware issue so took it to our local Apple Store but the Genius Bar said it passed the hardware tests fine and in the end they just re-installed MacOS Mojave EDIT: I needed to apply the ACS override patch to break up the IOMMU group the GPU is in. Still not working fully, but a step in the right direction. amp#x200B; So I've hit a wall here and am unsure what to do. I'm attempting dGPU passthrough on a Dell 7559 into some VMs. I've successfully gotten the device to passthrough, it's been recognized, and the NVIDIA drivers install and get to the point of requesting a reboot. After that, error 43. amp#x200B; I'm guessing this is an issue Hello all, Wondering if you could help me diagnose an error report. I have a mid 2012 macbook pro, macOS Mojave 10.14.3 that has been running flawlessly until now. Now it randomly shuts off and restarts! very frustrating!!! I have changed out the 8GB memory which helped a little with the amount of time it crashed, but still shuts down randomly. I am going to attach an error report for your viewing pleasure. Can someone please walk me through this report. Thank you for your time! Will Anonymo. 
Hey folks, I just picked up a GA-7PESH2 and some of these (https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0728KRZYB) with the hopes to connect all my sata hdds using the mini-sas ports on the motherboard. amp#x200B; I booted up my (preexisting) freenas img and can't seem find the drives so I don't know what to think. Was I naive to think it would be plug and play? Do I need to format the disks differently? Do I need to configure the OS or motherboard in a particular way? Any help is apprec.
